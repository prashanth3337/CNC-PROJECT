# CNC-PROJECT
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a vital component of modern manufacturing, widely used for producing high-precision components across industries. These systems rely on automated control of machining tools, often monitored through real-time sensor data such as vibration, acoustic, or temperature signals.
