# CNC-PROJECT
CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is a vital component of modern manufacturing, widely used for producing high-precision components across industries. These systems rely on automated control of machining tools, often monitored through real-time sensor data such as vibration, acoustic, or temperature signals. However, unexpected anomalies—caused by tool wear, material inconsistencies, or machine faults—can lead to reduced product quality, equipment damage, and unplanned downtime
Anomaly detection in CNC machining is crucial for ensuring reliability and enabling predictive maintenance. Traditional approaches often involve manual thresholding or classical machine learning techniques like Random Forest and Isolation Forest. These methods typically require hand-crafted feature extraction (e.g., mean, RMS, standard deviation), which may fail to capture complex patterns in time-series sensor data. Moreover, they lack adaptability to dynamic operating environments and are limited in detecting subtle or previously unseen anomalies.
To address these limitations, this study proposes the use of an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Autoencoder, a type of deep learning model designed to handle sequential data. The model learns normal operational patterns directly from raw vibration signals without manual feature engineering. During inference, it reconstructs the input sequence, and deviations between the input and output—quantified as reconstruction error—are used to identify anomalies.
The LSTM Autoencoder offers several advantages: it captures long-term dependencies in time-series data, supports unsupervised learning (ideal when anomaly labels are unavailable), and generalizes well to varying operational conditions. By minimizing preprocessing and manual intervention, the model provides a scalable and efficient solution for real-time monitoring in smart manufacturing systems. This work demonstrates that deep learning-based approaches like LSTM Autoencoders can significantly enhance the accuracy, adaptability, and robustness of anomaly detection in CNC machining environments.
